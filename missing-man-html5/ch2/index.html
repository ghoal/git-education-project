		<p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it
		could all fall apart. In this article, you'll learn about a few of our
		favorites.</p>

		<h3>Mayan Doomsday</h3>
		<p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new
		5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually predict a life-ending
		apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about
		virtually everything else, why should we trust them on this?
		</p>

		<h3>Robot Takeover</h3>
		<p>Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead
		Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a disquieting thought. We are
		already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates
		fears the day his Japanese robot slave turns him over by the ankles
		and asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"

		We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't
		just end, maybe today.
		<img src="images/quotes_end.png" alt="End quote">
		</aside>

		<h3>Unexplained Singularity</h3>
		<p>We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't
		just end, maybe today, and maybe with nothing more exciting than a
		puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.</p>

		<h3>Runaway Climate Change</h3>
		<p>Dismissed by some, Al Gore's prophecy of doom may still come true. If
		it does, we may have to contend with vicious storms, widespread food
		shortages, and surly air conditioning repairmen.</p>

		<h3>Global Epidemic</h3>
		<p>Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Predictions
		differ about the source of the disease, but candidates include
		monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, birds and pigs with the
		flu, warriors from the future, an alien race, hospitals that use too
		many antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed brussel sprouts.
		Whatever the source, it's clearly bad news.
