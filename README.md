"missing-manual-ch2" folder

Changed the original website from chapter 2 and the online website sample "http://prosetech.com/html5/Chapter%2002/ApocalypseSite.html" related to the "HTML5 missing manual" by MacDonald, Matthew. I didn't do much just created navigation menu and changed the aside section to from left to right because it looks better aesthetically (my opinion). 

I am relearning html and css from years before and these exercises proved very beneficial. I will eventually create original 
websites, but until then this is fun.

created folders for chapters 2,4,5,7 missing manual book: fixed the navigation menu for the individual websites, changed css from one external file to 2 files, used javascript from google search for media type detection.
